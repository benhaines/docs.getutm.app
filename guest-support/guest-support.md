In order to take full advantage of all the features UTM has to offer, you need to install some software in the virtual machine guest. Currently only [Windows]({% link guest-support/windows.md %}) (excluding older versions) and [Linux]({% link guest-support/linux.md %}) have all the drivers and tools to support all of UTM's features. If you run an operating system that is not supported by the guest tools, some of the following features may not work:

* Directory sharing
* Clipboard sharing
* Dynamic screen resolution
* Mouse cursor **macOS**{: .label .label-green } without "capturing" or **iOS**{: .label .label-blue } in "tablet mode"
