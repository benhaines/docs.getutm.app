## Highlights
* **iOS SE**{: .label .label-blue } **TCTI backend updates**. Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.
* **macOS**{: .label .label-green } **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.
* **macOS**{: .label .label-green } **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page]({% link scripting/reference.html %}) for more details and [the cheat sheet]({% link scripting/cheat-sheet.md %}) for example usage.
* **macOS**{: .label .label-green } **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when "read only" is unchecked in the settings).
