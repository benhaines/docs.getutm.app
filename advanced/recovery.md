Recovery mode is only supported on Apple backend for macOS guests.

To run a macOS guest in 1TR (One-True-Recovery) mode, [open the action menu]({% link basics/actions.md %}) and select "Run Recovery". This will allow you to change advanced settings such as [disabling System Integrity Protection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection).
